# gitnotify

A command-line (CLI) tool for monitoring new GitHub notifications.

## Usage

This tool supports notifications via Growl. When a notification is displayed, clicking on it will mark it as read. If you want to reload all notifications from the beginning, set `'status' -> 'clear' = 1` in the configuration file (`gitnotify.ini`). This is necessary because, after some time, notifications will time out once they are sent to Growl.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
